# ðŸ§¾ Expense-Tracker-Backend

This is the Spring Boot backend server that works behind the [Client-Expense-Tracker-GUI](https://github.com/Bokorou/Client-Expense-Tracker-GUI) â€” a personal finance desktop app I built using Java.

The backend exposes RESTful APIs that allows users to manage data such as transactions, categories, and account information. All data is persisted to a MySQL database using Spring Data JPA.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This project was created to:
- Learn backend architecture using Spring Boot
- Practice designing REST APIs from scratch
- Understand how a GUI communicates with a server
- Work with SQL databases through JPA
- Explore data serialization via JSON

---

## ðŸš€ What It Does

- Exposes secure API endpoints for the client
- Performs full CRUD operations for:
  - Transactions
  - Transaction categories
  - User accounts
- Uses pagination and filtering to serve transaction history
- Connects to a MySQL database using JPA
- Returns JSON responses to the client application

---

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts I Learned

- How to structure a real-world Spring Boot project
- Setting up RESTful routes and controllers
- Persisting and querying data using JPA repositories
- Connecting JavaFX frontends to a backend server
- Debugging and testing endpoints using Postman
- Configuring `application.properties` for database connectivity

---

## ðŸ§  Reflection

Working on this project really opened my eyes to how powerful Spring Boot is for building backend systems. 
It helped me see Java as more than just syntax but also as a way to build useful, real-world applications that people interact with every day.
In the process I was introduced to some interesting real-world concepts like:
- Port configuration
- Data transfer via JSON
- Structuring API projects cleanly
- Managing data persistence with JPA
- API authentication & testing workflows
